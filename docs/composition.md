# Asset composition and staging

How exported layers become the files that downstream workfiles import.

## Department exports and staged files

Every publish writes a versioned layer under
`export/<entity>/<variant>/<department>/v####/` together with a
`context.json` sidecar. The sidecar's `parameters.assets` records every
pipeline asset present on the exported stage (scraped from the
`customData` metadata that import nodes author on asset root prims).

The *staged* file (`_staged/<variant>/v####/<Entity>_v####.usda`) is what
imports actually load. For an asset it sublayers, strongest first:

1. the asset's own department layers in pipeline order
   (e.g. lookdev over model),
2. the staged file of every asset tracked in those department layers —
   the *nested assets* of a set-style asset — weaker than the asset's
   own layers, so its placement overrides win. Tracked refs carry the
   sub-asset's variant and are pinned to its staged version at build
   time, so a pinned build stays frozen; `latest`-mode imports strip
   or ignore the pin, so floating still cascades.

When department layers disagree about a tracked asset (instance count,
variant, inputs), the **most recently exported** layer that records it
wins, as one consistent snapshot. It is never a `max()` across layers:
a stale department — lookdev exported before a model rework halved the
copies — would pin the old count forever, because any workfile that
imports the staged asset re-composes the inflated count onto its stage
and scrapes it back into its own next export.

Shot staged files work the same way: shot department layers, then
shot-flow assets, then the root department (which carries the scene
reference).

## Two ways to build multi-asset environments

- **Scenes and groups** (config-driven): a scene lists member assets in
  the project configuration; the scene's staged file sublayers each
  member's staged file, and shots pick the scene up through their root
  department. Placement lives in the scene.
- **Nested assets** (workfile-driven): import assets directly into
  another asset's workfile (e.g. dressing a `SET` with towers and
  props). The export tracks the imported assets through their prim
  metadata — including copies made with Duplicate LOPs — and the staged
  build re-references each one, so the set composes complete geometry
  downstream. Placement lives in the set's workfile.

Both compose transparently: a shot that imports the set (or a scene
containing it) resolves the nested assets through the set's staged file.

Because exported layers carry neither pipeline metadata nor the
Duplicate LOP's instance defs (the layerbreak strips everything the
authoring workfile composed), every consumption point re-establishes
them: the import nodes re-tag each tracked asset root from the staged
`context.json` and re-define multi-instance duplicates
(`{name}0..{name}N-1` referencing the base prim, base deactivated),
and the render-stage flatten generates the same instance definitions.

## Department exclusion

The *Exclude departments* setting on the import nodes filters the staged
layer stack per department, and applies through nesting: excluding
`lookdev` when importing a set also drops the lookdev layers of every
nested asset.

## Render staging

Farm renders do not compose the staged file directly. The stage task
builds a dedicated LOP graph per render layer (variant) and exports it
to a `stage_<variant>.usd` that husk then renders. The graph — built by
`tumblepipe.pipe.houdini.render_stage.build_render_stage_graph`, and
identically by the `th::render_debug` HDA for in-session inspection —
composes, weakest to strongest:

1. the shot's staged build for that variant, **pinned**: the inner
   import shot runs at `version='current'`, which keeps the frozen
   `version=` parameter on every sublayer URI. (The interactive
   `latest` mode strips versions, and the resolver floats a
   version-less URI to whatever is newest on disk at resolve time —
   acceptable in a live session, wrong on a farm where frames resolve
   hours apart on different workers.)
2. the root default prims (`config:/usd/root_default_prims.usda`,
   render settings and RenderVar prims),
3. one import-layer per renderable shot department at its `current`
   export, so a render picks up department publishes made since the
   last shot build without a rebuild,
4. the render-settings overrides from the submission's
   `render_settings.json`, then pruning of AOVs not selected for the
   render.

Each variant gets its **own** graph and export — variants are
alternative opinions on the same prims, so a single stage composing
several of them would just render the strongest one for every layer.

To preview exactly what the farm will render, drop a
`th::render_debug` node and pick the shot and variant; its dive target
contains the same graph the stage task exports.

## Performance note

A set-style asset's staged file composes the full geometry of all its
nested assets, so first loads pull considerably more data than the set's
own layers alone. This is expected; if it becomes a bottleneck, deferred
loading (payload arcs for tracked assets) is the design lever.
